# Machine Learning in Python - Project 2

Due Friday, April 9th by 5 pm (UK local time)

## Data

For this assignment we will be using data collected by [Antonio, Almeida and Nunes, 2019](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352340918315191#f0010) on hotel bookings. These data come from the booking systems of two real hotels and reflect bookings made between July 1st, 2015 through August 31st 2017. This is a large dataset (119,390 observations) and real world (i.e. messy) data set,  care will be needed to check for and to address underlying data quality issues.

The data set contains the following variables:

|variable                       |description |
|:------------------------------|:-----------|
|is_canceled                    | Value indicating if the booking was canceled (1) or not (0) |
|hotel                          | Hotel (`Resort Hotel` or `City Hotel`) |
|lead_time                      | Number of days that elapsed between the entering date of the booking into the PMS and the arrival date |
|arrival_date_year              | Year of arrival date|
|arrival_date_month             | Month of arrival date|
|arrival_date_week_number       | Week number of year for arrival date|
|arrival_date_day_of_month      | Day of arrival date|
|stays_in_weekend_nights        | Number of weekend nights (Saturday or Sunday) the guest stayed or booked to stay at the hotel |

|required_car_parking_spaces    | Number of car parking spaces required by the customer |
|total_of_special_requests      | Number of special requests made by the customer (e.g. twin bed or high floor)|



## Assignment

For the purposes of the project, consider yourself a Data Scientist who has been hired by a large hotel operator who has provided these data in the hope of better understanding why customers cancel their reservations. The two hotels present in the data are individual representative examples of their resort and city properties. Using these data they would like you to construct a predictive model that can accurately predict when a booking will be canceled. In this case they are primarily interested in the accuracy of the model but they are also intested in understanding what aspects of a booking affect the likelihood of it being canceled.

As such, you need to develop an *understandable* *validated* model for the `is_canceled` variable as the outcome of interest using features derived from the data. As before it is important that this model be accurate **and** reliable and any conclusions you draw well supported. We explicitly do not want a blackbox model - you should be able to explain and justify your modeling choices and your model's predictions.

Your model may use as few or as many of the provided features, and you may transform and manipulate these features in any way that you want to generate additional features. Also note as these data are directly derived from the hotels' booking system there is the possibility of incorrect / unreasonable data being present - performing basic sanity checks and validation on the features is strongly recommended as part of your exploratory data analysis. You are welcome to exclude as much or as little of the data as you would like, but these choices should be clearly justified in your text.

We have covered a number of models and modeling approaches in the lectures and workshops and you should explore a variety of different approaches for this particular task. However, your ultimate goal is to deliver a **single** model. These are competing interests and it is up to you to find a reasonable balance between the two - some of your marks will be based on how well you accomplish this.


### Client Requirements

Your report (in the discussion section) must include the following:

* Some discussion of the features that are most important for predicting a cancelation - we do not need discussion of specific coefficient values but direction of the effect should be clear (e.g. the earlier a booking is made the more likely it is to be canceled).

* A validated assessment of your model's performance, but this must be specifically discussed in the context of bookings and running a hotel. It is not sufficient to report summary statistics like the accuracy or AUC - you must address the perfomance in terms of potential gains and losses for the hotel (e.g. think about what happens if your model predicts a cancelation that does not actually occur and a room ends up being double booked or vice versa). Explain why you think your particular model would or would not be economically viable.


## Required Structure & Formatting

We have provided a templated Jupyter notebook called `proj2.ipynb` which includes the required sections along with brief instructions on what should be included in each section. Your completed assignment must follow this structure - you should not add or remove any of these sections, if you feel it is necessary you may add addition subsections within each. Please remove the instructions for each section in the final document.

All of your work must be contained in the `proj2.ipynb` notebook, we will only mark what is included in this file.

Our expectation is that most projects will be roughly 10-15 pages in length (text & figures, excluding code). Your notebook must include all of your work, but make sure that you are only retaining required components, e.g. remove unused code and figures (if a figure is not explicitly discussed in the text it should not be in the final document).

Overall, your project will be partially assessed on your organization / presentation of the document - it should be as polished and streamlined as possible. We highly recommend that you check the appearance of your rendered PDF before submitting, as its appearance can differ significantly from the notebook.

## Group work

This project may be completed by a team of up to 4 students. We will not be assigning or forming teams, if you are a team that is looking for more members or someone looking for a team please use the pinned post on Piazza to find each other.

After the assignment is completed we will distribute a brief peer evaluation survey - members who contributed significantly less than their peers will potentially have their overall mark penalized.

## Submission

This project is due Friday, April 9th by 5 pm (UK local time). You are expected to submit your completed work as follows:

* Submit a PDF of your report (generated from a Jupyter notebook) to the Project 1 assignment on Gradescope.

* Submit your `ipynb` notebook file and any supplementary data and script files to the Project 1 assignment on Learn.

Both submission steps are necessary for your work to be considered submitted. Standard late penalties will apply if either piece is not submitted by the deadline.

For a team submission - all contributors should be added to the assignment. Only one team member needs to submit the ipynb notebook on Learn.



## Marking Rubric

The project will be marked out of 100, and we will be using the following rubric to roughly guide the marking:

* **>90**: The code runs without errors. Models are implemented, fit, and assessed correctly. The final model achieves a high level of predictive accuracy and is well documented and described in the writeup. There is significant and creative additional investigation of the problem including the use of addition data sources for features. Potentially could be used as a model answer. Write-up evidences deep understanding of the data and the model(s).

* **80-89**: The code runs without errors. Models are implemented, fit, and assessed correctly. The write up is generally good and the code is appropriately commented. The final model achieves a reasonable level of predictive accuracy and is well documented and described in the writeup. There is moderate additional investigation of the problem. Write-up evidences good understanding of the data and the model(s).

* **70-79**: The code runs without errors. Models are implemented, fit, and assessed correctly with only minor issues. The write-up is reasonable but could be better. Write-up evidences adequate understanding of the data and the model(s).

* **60-69**: The code runs without errors. Models are implemented, fit, and assessed correctly with only moderate issues. The write-up is ok but could be better, includes some moderate errors or omissions. Write-up evidences adequate understanding of the data and the model(s).

* **50-59**: The code runs with some errors. Models are implemented, fit, and assessed but with some significant issues in implementation and or understanding. The write-up is marginal and includes some significant errors or omissions. Write-up evidences an incomplete understanding of the data and the model(s).

* **<49**: Significant issues with the code, model(s), and/or the write up. Write-up evidences an incomplete understanding of the data and the model(s).

Using these criteria, specific rubrics will be used to assess each of the 4 required sections of the project.
